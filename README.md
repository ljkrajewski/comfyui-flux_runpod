# comfyui-flux_runpod
ComfyUI with Flux model to run on Runpod.io

## Support
There isn't any.

Okay, that was rude of me, but to be completely candid I built this for me to fit my needs. If you can use it, great! If you want to make a change so it can fit your needs better, go ahead. If you have a question, you can ask, but I may not have the time or knowledge to answer. Remember: The key to happiness is low expectations.

## Changelog
2024.08.09: Initial build with flux1-dev-fp8 model.
